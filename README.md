# Blog App based on Colt Steele's Udemy Tutorial
Semantic-ui, ejs, express, mongoose and node.js


Current dilemma:

show.ejs

ui icon buttons 'group'
within - have an animated button inside an <a> tag to redirect to edit page -- works
the 'normal' form delete button works - deletes the post 
however --- trying to use an animated button with the form -- 

So the button group now contains 4 btns.
Edit, Trash, Delete, Home
The 'normal' Delete button will be removed once the Trash button starts working.

Styling:
Navbar -- change color to #AFCECF enlarge font-size
segment - new page: #7eb1b3
softer white - #f0ffff

Limited icon choice with Semantic.
Considering adding fontawesome to the mix.
